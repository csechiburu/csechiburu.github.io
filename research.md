<h1> X-ray binaries </h1>

X-ray binaries are binary systems composed of a compact object (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole) that is "stealing" material from a companion star. Since this material carries angular momentum it does not fall directly onto the surface of the compact object, but instead forms an accretion disk around it. 

These systems display an interesting transient behaviour. In <em>quiescence</em>, the X-ray luminosity is fairly faint due to the low level of accretion. On the contrary, the <em>outburst</em> phase is characterized by a rapid increase in the X-ray luminosity and accretion levels that vary over the course of this phase (also known as <em>spectral states</em>).

I have studied both neutron stars and stellar mass black holes in the context of X-ray binaries. Here is a summary of my work.
