<h2> X-ray binaries </h2>

X-ray binaries are binary systems composed of a <strong>compact object</strong> (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole) that is "stealing" material from a <strong>companion star</strong>. Since this material carries angular momentum it does not fall directly onto the surface of the compact object, but instead forms an <strong>accretion disk</strong> around it. 

These systems display an interesting transient behaviour. In <em>quiescence</em>, the X-ray luminosity is fairly faint due to the low level of accretion. On the contrary, the <em>outburst</em> phase is characterized by a rapid increase in the X-ray luminosity and accretion levels that vary over the course of this phase (giving rise to different <em>spectral states</em>). I have studied neutron stars and stellar mass black holes in the context of X-ray binaries. Both compact objects are the remnants of massive stars that end their lives in violent explosions known as supernovae. That said, here is a summary of my work.
