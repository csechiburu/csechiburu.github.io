<h2> X-ray binaries </h2>

X-ray binaries are binary systems composed of a <strong>compact object</strong> (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole) that is "stealing" material from a <strong>companion star</strong>. Since this material carries angular momentum it does not fall directly onto the surface of the compact object, but instead forms an <strong>accretion disk</strong> around it. The disk is one of the prominent structures that we observe in these type of binaries.

These systems also display an interesting transient behaviour. In <em>quiescence</em>, the X-ray luminosity is fairly faint due to the low level of accretion. On the contrary, the <em>outburst</em> phase is characterized by a rapid increase in the X-ray luminosity and accretion levels that vary over the course of this phase (giving rise to different <em>spectral states</em>). I have studied neutron stars and stellar mass black holes in the context of X-ray binaries. Both compact objects are the remnants of massive stars that end their lives in violent explosions known as supernovae. That said, here is a summary of my work.

<h3> Stellar mass black holes </h3>

<h3> Neutron stars </h3>

<!-- The fundamental difference between BHs and NSs is that neutron stars can be observed directly. In quiescence, the X-ray emission is dominated by the star and not the disk, so we can characterize its surface emission!

<strong> What can we learn? </strong>

NSs are one of the most extreme objects in the Universe. Particularly in their cores, densities overcome that of the nucleus of an atom. Since those conditions are difficult to reproduce on Earth, NSs provide a unique place to study the behaviour of matter at such extreme densities. Measuring the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, such as their mass and radius, is helpful to constrain the equation of state of ultra-dense matter. One promising method to constrain neutron star radii consists of the study of low-mass X-ray binaries in quiescence (qLMXB), i.e., during periods of low accretion levels. In quiescence, we can model the surface emission as a single-composition atmosphere dominated by light elements. 

<strong> My work </strong>

I used <em>Chandra</em> X-ray observations of the globular cluster M30, which hosts a qLMXB. With this data we were able to characterize the thermal emission of the NS with light-element composition atmosphere models (hydrogen or helium), and from there constrain the mass-radius relation for both models. -->
