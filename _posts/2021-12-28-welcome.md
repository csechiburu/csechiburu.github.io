I am a PhD student in the [Astrophysics and Planetary Sciences Department](https://www.colorado.edu/aps/) at the University of Colorado Boulder.

I was born in Santiago, Chile (see cover photo) where I earned my BSc in Astronomy at the [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](https://admisionyregistros.uc.cl/futuros-alumnos/conoce-la-uc/carreras/1007-carreras-pregrado-astronomia). During my undergraduate thesis I worked with Dr. [Sebastien Guillot](http://userpages.irap.omp.eu/~sguillot/) and Prof. Andreas Reisenegger in X-ray observations of neutron stars.

After that I moved to Montreal, Canada, where I received my MSc in Physics at [McGill University](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca).
