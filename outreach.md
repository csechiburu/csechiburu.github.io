Pioneering outreach program that consists of leading bilingual online observing nights at the observatory (in English and Spanish). The primary goal is to highlight the contribution of Latin. American astronomers to the field while educating. I had the opportunity to mentor a student willing to learn about astronomy, prepare a talk (now available on <a>href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCom3frTr5azQtlcBti6KgA"> YouTube</a>) and operate the telescopes.</p>
