Pioneering outreach program that consists of leading online observing nights in English and Spanish at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sbo/"> Sommers-Bausch Observatory</a>. The primary goal is to highlight the contribution of Latin American astronomers to the field while educating the audience. I had the opportunity to mentor a student willing to learn about astronomy, prepare a talk (now available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCom3frTr5azQtlcBti6KgA"> YouTube</a>) and operate the telescopes. More details can be found <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sbo/student-activities/multiculturalism-sbo-multiculturalismo-en-sbo"> here</a>.</p>

<h2>PACE UC</h2>

The PACE UC[^fn-1] aims to make higher education more equitable. This program is led by the government and <a href="https://inclusion.uc.cl/pace-uc/" partner universities</a> and targets students from underprivileged backgrounds, a vast majority of students in Chile. Based on the student’s participation in courses offered by the program, they can apply to a unique spot to start a career of their choice at PUC. This process removes the bias introduced by their high school grades and their performance in selection exams. In that way, access to higher education depends only on participation, crucial to inclusive education. My role was helping to design and teach an elective course about Astronomy and our place in the universe. I taught this class once a week for three semesters..</p>
